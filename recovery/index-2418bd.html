<h1>
XOR Problem with Neural Network
</h1>
<div id="canvas-container"></div>
<p>
  This sketch solves the XOR problem with a Neural Network. Specifically, it
  uses Dan Shiffman's Toy Neural Network and is copied from his video
  Coding Challenge 92: XOR Problem on YouTube. The left side is the solution
  space for the problem in 2D and the right side is the graph of the loss
  function of the neural network over time.
