<h1>Evolving Steering Behaviors</h1>
<p>
  This sketch is an elaboration on a <a href="https://youtu.be/ykOcaInciBI">Coding Challenge (#69)</a>
   done on the Coding Train
  by Dan Shiffman. I began with the code from the end of part 4 and added several things.
  For a list of things that I changed, <a href="/changes.html">see this page.</a>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Altruism: Each Vehicle can see other Vehicles and may seek them out. When encountering
  another Vehicle, a Vehicle may choose to share some of its health (food) with that Vehicle.
  Both the distance at which a Vehicle can be seen and the willingness to share food are integrated
  into the DNA of the Vehicles and can evolve.
  <ul>
