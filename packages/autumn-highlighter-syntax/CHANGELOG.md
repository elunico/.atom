## 3.0.1

* adjusted color red and added screenshots.

## 2.2.3

* synced with upstream and adjusted colors again.

## 2.2.2

* update screenshot url due to rawgit shutting down

## 2.2.1

* prevents string syntax color from bleeding into values inside interpolated strings

## 2.2.0

* brings back red for variable color. This ended up affecting a ton of stuff, and we need this to not be the same as the text color. Red still feels strong, but a lot of other themes are using red for this as well, so for now I'm just switching it back. Maybe someday I'll come back to this.

## 2.1.0

* add syntax highlighting for `language-html-angular`

## 2.0.1

* make booleans red in JSON files

## 2.0.0

Major version bump! This is mainly due to the adjustment of how much red is in the color scheme. Many file types, especially JavaScript, ended up having a LOT of red. This is because the `.syntax--variable` class was getting a color of red applied to it as a default, and only was overridden in language-specific stylesheets. That class is used in a lot of places, hence causing a lot of red. I changed the default variable color to be the same as the text foreground color and only overrode it in certain places. I also made JSON files a lot less red by making property declarations blue instead, it is much easier on the eyes now.

I also enhanced support for Sass, SCSS, Stylus, and YAML files.

Finally, I added a `demo` folder with sample files in a bunch of different languages, inspired by Wes Bos and Sarah Drasner. It's a great way to pull down the repo and see what this theme looks like in a bunch of languages.
